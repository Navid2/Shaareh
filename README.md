# The Vision

interactive web-application for poem explanation.

## First Of Its Kind

All of us have seen Ganjoor before, because I assume you are passionate about Iranian poems to some degree just like I am.
What I tried to do with this project, was to add more elegance and interactivity to a new poem explanation web-application. This was a passion project that I pursued a year back with a partner. He'd been doing poem explanation activity from a couple of years back. Long story short, the partnership didn't work and in the end, due to me being busy and dissapointment, I didn't go on to complete this project.

## Significance

Iranian Poems are one of the richest of heritages, to move through them grasping a little bit of them one at a time would be a great comfort and joy to literature enthusiasts, by extension it can attract a new audience to these underrated pieces.

## Branding

My partner had this existing website at shaareh.ir (he's been doing a good job by the way, worths a visit) and we agreed to continue with Shaareh, but since he dropped out, now we require a new brand.
